Drawing on the revised Uppsala internationalization model and network theory, this paper suggests that the effects of BG affiliation on international sales intensity and diversification depend on the geographical dispersion of the BG network ties, the size and the age of the firm, and the institutional support in the home country. Thus, we find that interfirm networks in the form of BGs are a double-edged sword that can have both favorable and unfavorable consequences for international sales, depending on the geographical dispersion of the BG’s ties. In addition, the results reveal that BG affiliation is more beneficial for smaller SMEs and SMEs in countries with lower institutional support that are more dependent on the network resources embedded within BG networks.","tags":[],"title":"Business group affiliation and SMEs’ international sales intensity and diversification: A multi-country study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Eduardsen","Svetla Marinova","Bozidar Vlacic","Miguel Gonzales-Loueiro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1618072321,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618072321,"objectID":"7f9c23fb2cfea49c322ab041d539db1e","permalink":"https://jonaseduardsen.github.io/publication/eduardsen2021/","publishdate":"2022-04-10T18:32:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eduardsen2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this study is to examine how business group (BG) affiliation influences the export propensity of new ventures (NVs). To help address the inconsistency of past research on the value of BG affiliation for firms seeking to expand their business abroad, the authors provide a contingency perspective by exploring how organizational characteristics and BG characteristics condition the value of BG affiliation. The authors analyze the impact of BG affiliation on the export propensity of NVs, including the factors that condition this impact, by using a sample of 2,874 European NVs. The primary contribution of this study is to determine the impact of BG affiliation on the export propensity of NVs, including the moderating effects of firm size on the BG affiliation–export propensity relationship. The findings show that the export propensity of NVs affiliated with BGs is significantly higher than for stand-alone NVs. However, the findings demonstrate that the impact of BG affiliation on export propen- sity depends on the network characteristics of the BG in terms of the geo- graphical dispersion of network ties. Consequently, the findings suggest that BG affiliation provides advantages for NV exporting only if it provides access to international inter-firm networks thus acting as a compensatory mechanism for liability of outsidership and liability of newness in foreign markets. In such cases, BG affiliation is a major resource capital that equipoises the somewhat limited financial resource provision for NV internationalization.","tags":[],"title":"Business Group Affiliation and Export Propensity in New Ventures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Eduardsen"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"I’m happy to share a recent publication that I have written together with my colleagues Svetla Marinova, Bozidar Vlacic and Miguel Gonzalez Loureiro which have been accepted for publication in International Business Review and is now available online.\nThe study is one of few studies that examine the role of business group affiliation on SMEs international sales intensity and diversification in developed economies.

The aim is to advance the theoretical arguments that help explain the heterogeneous patterns of internationalisation for smaller ventures. Our framework includes the four-stage psychological process of decision-making: perception, options, evaluation and choice under the interactive effect of two-cognitive systems, namely experiential (Sys-1) and analytical (Sys-2). Based on interviews with six owners operating small ventures in high-tech industries, we found that accelerated patterns of internationalisation can be associated with increased levels of decision-makers experiential reasoning combined with lower levels of analytical reasoning interventions through the entire decision-making process of internationalising. Conversely, incremental and slower patterns of internationalisation can be associated with increased levels of analytical reasoning and lower levels of experiential interventions. Overall, we supplement the extant approaches to internationalisation with the Dual Process Theory of how individuals process information to make decisions.","tags":[],"title":"The process of the process of internationalisation: cognitive and behavioural perspectives in small ventures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Eduardsen","Svetla Marinova"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586853362,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586853362,"objectID":"f9fd0473281e59cc4f4115585770ca6f","permalink":"https://jonaseduardsen.github.io/publication/ibr_2020/","publishdate":"2022-04-14T10:36:02+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ibr_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Based on an in-depth review of 134 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1971 and 2018, this article presents a systematic accumulation and analysis of existing research on internationalisation and risk. The review shows that although risk has received great attention in the internationalisation literature in recent years, im- portant gaps remain in relation to the risk implications of internationalisation, the impact of risk on internationalisation strategy, and the strategies used to assess and manage risk in the internationalisation process. Our study contributes to existing knowledge by synthesising and organising existing research into an overarching integrative framework that provides a comprehensive understanding of the risk phenomenon, including the interrelations between risk and internationalisation and the sources and consequences of risk. In addition, the review contributes by identifying important gaps in the literature and suggesting directions for future research to improve our understanding of the complex interrelationship between risk and internationalisation.","tags":[],"title":"Internationalisation and risk: Literature review, integrative framework and research agenda","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Eduardsen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586536802,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586536802,"objectID":"604d15aeb971a71358db14ef101d2f0c","permalink":"https://jonaseduardsen.github.io/publication/eduardsen2020-covid19/","publishdate":"2022-04-10T18:40:02+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eduardsen2020-covid19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Covid-19, Global Value Chains, Risk, and Resilience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Svetla Marinova","Jonas Eduardsen","Marin Marinov"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1555232079,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555232079,"objectID":"a63057913e8eeff1cf8729015424be8f","permalink":"https://jonaseduardsen.github.io/publication/value-cocreation_2019/","publishdate":"2022-04-14T10:54:39+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/value-cocreation_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Value Co-Creation in Social Media Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bozidar Vlacic","Miguel Gonzalez-Loureiro","Jonas Eduardsen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1555231894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555231894,"objectID":"7376cf5d494c9cdd3d1f41be36d6712e","permalink":"https://jonaseduardsen.github.io/publication/igi-handbook_2019/","publishdate":"2022-04-14T10:51:34+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/igi-handbook_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Internationalization of SMEs: Strategic Choices Under a Cognitive Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne \rTwo \rThree \r A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

By applying the Uppsala Internationalisation Process model, this chapter examines the impact of e-commerce on the internationalisation of SMEs. The study uses a unique dataset, which includes 14,513 SMEs across several sectors in 34 countries. The results show that firms using the Internet as a means to provide information about the firm exhibit a higher degree of internationalisation, while using the Internet to facilitate transactions was found to have a positive impact on the ratio of foreign sales to the total sales; however, these foreign sales are likely to be concentrated in less regions/markets. Furthermore, perceived export barriers were found to be a significant moderator of the effects of e-commerce usage on international intensity and international diversification. This suggests that e-commerce does not automatically facilitate the internationalisation of SMEs.","tags":[],"title":"Internationalization through digitalization: The impact of E-Commerce usage on internationalization in small and medium-sized firm","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
