Drawing on the revised Uppsala internationalization model and network theory, this paper suggests that the effects of BG affiliation on international sales intensity and diversification depend on the geographical dispersion of the BG network ties, the size and the age of the firm, and the institutional support in the home country. Thus, we find that interfirm networks in the form of BGs are a double-edged sword that can have both favorable and unfavorable consequences for international sales, depending on the geographical dispersion of the BG’s ties. In addition, the results reveal that BG affiliation is more beneficial for smaller SMEs and SMEs in countries with lower institutional support that are more dependent on the network resources embedded within BG networks.","tags":[],"title":"Business group affiliation and SMEs’ international sales intensity and diversification: A multi-country study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Eduardsen","Svetla Marinova","Bozidar Vlacic","Miguel Gonzales-Loueiro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1618072321,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618072321,"objectID":"7f9c23fb2cfea49c322ab041d539db1e","permalink":"https://jonaseduardsen.github.io/publication/eduardsen2021/","publishdate":"2022-04-10T18:32:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eduardsen2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this study is to examine how business group (BG) affiliation influences the export propensity of new ventures (NVs). To help address the inconsistency of past research on the value of BG affiliation for firms seeking to expand their business abroad, the authors provide a contingency perspective by exploring how organizational characteristics and BG characteristics condition the value of BG affiliation. The authors analyze the impact of BG affiliation on the export propensity of NVs, including the factors that condition this impact, by using a sample of 2,874 European NVs. The primary contribution of this study is to determine the impact of BG affiliation on the export propensity of NVs, including the moderating effects of firm size on the BG affiliation–export propensity relationship. The findings show that the export propensity of NVs affiliated with BGs is significantly higher than for stand-alone NVs. However, the findings demonstrate that the impact of BG affiliation on export propen- sity depends on the network characteristics of the BG in terms of the geo- graphical dispersion of network ties. Consequently, the findings suggest that BG affiliation provides advantages for NV exporting only if it provides access to international inter-firm networks thus acting as a compensatory mechanism for liability of outsidership and liability of newness in foreign markets. In such cases, BG affiliation is a major resource capital that equipoises the somewhat limited financial resource provision for NV internationalization.","tags":[],"title":"Business Group Affiliation and Export Propensity in New Ventures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Eduardsen"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"I’m happy to share a recent publication that I have written together with my colleagues Svetla Marinova, Bozidar Vlacic and Miguel Gonzalez Loureiro which have been accepted for publication in International Business Review and is now available online.\nThe study is one of few studies that examine the role of business group affiliation on SMEs international sales intensity and diversification in developed economies.
