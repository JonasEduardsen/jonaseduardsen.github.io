I'm happy to share a recent publication that I have written together with my colleagues Svetla Marinova, Bozidar Vlacic and Miguel Gonzalez Loureiro which have been accepted for publication in International Business Review and is now available online.

The study is one of few studies that examine the role of business group affiliation on SMEs international sales intensity and diversification in developed economies. The study uses a multi-country sample of over 13,000 European SMEs from 34 different countries to examine under what conditions business group affiliation is beneficial to the international sales of SMEs.
