In the following days I will be participating in the annual Academy of International Business Conference in Miami, USA. The theme of this years conference is 'Beyond Diversity and Inclusion: Equity and Fairness in International Business'.

During the conference, I will be presenting some early-stage on cross-border e-commerce. In this study, I analyze the managerial perceptions of barriers to cross-border e-commerce using a sample of 2,478 European firms using Latent Profile Analysis. The study demonstrates that the sample of European firms can be classified into four distinct profiles (i.e. homogeneous subgroups) based on the perceived and experienced export barriers related to CBEC, highlighting the heterogeneity in the CBEC barriers experienced by firms. After exploring the impact of covariates on latent profile membership it was found that latent profile membership probabilities differed significantly across industries and countries, while firm size and firm experience appeared to be less relevant in predicting latent profile membership. Thus the results highlights the importance of the environmental context - in terms of industry and home country context - and underscore the potential importance of policy factors in addition to institutional factors. Thus, our results indicate that careful attention must be paid to the economic and regulatory factors that may affect the barriers related to CBEC adoption and diffusion across different countries. This is in line with previous earlier studies highlighting the significant impact of the national environment and policy as an important driver or barriers that can either facilitate or limit e-commerce growth
