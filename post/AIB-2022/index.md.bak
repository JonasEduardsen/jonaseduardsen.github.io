Next week I will be participating in the annual Academy of International Business Conference in Miami, which is hosted by Florida International University. The theme this year is 'Beyond Diversity and Inclusion: Equity and Fairness in International Business'. Thus, there will be ample opportunity to discuss how IB scholars can increasingly integrate Equity and Fairness into IB research and the post-pandemic globalization.

During the conference, I will be presenting some preliminary findings from my research on cross-border e-commerce in European firms, where I explore heterogeneity in managerial perceptions of barriers to cross-border e-commerce across firms, industries, and countries.

This will be the first time since 2019 in Copenhagen where the conference will take place physically.
